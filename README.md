# Build-ML-workflow-on-AWS-with-Step-functions

This project is a part of Nanodgree program of Udacity course.

In this project was built an image classification model that can automatically detect which kind of vehicle delivery drivers have, in order to route them to the correct loading bay and orders. Assigning delivery professionals who have a bicycle to nearby orders and giving motorcyclists orders that are farther can help Scones Unlimited optimize their operations.

In this project, I use AWS Sagemaker to build an image classification model that can tell bicycles apart from motorcycles. Then model deployed by using AWS Lambda functions to build supporting services, and AWS Step Functions to compose model and services into an event-driven application. At the end of this project, its created a portfolio-ready demo that showcases ability to build and compose scalable, ML-enabled, AWS applications.
